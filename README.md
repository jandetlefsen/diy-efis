We will be posting to this regularly as the 2017 build gets closer.  This project has designs from 2016 that have been tested.  The code has been subsntially re-written and will be release when flight testing is completed.

The project has 3 core streams:

** diy-efis **
Portable C code that implements a full graphical display for avionics that can run on very low power devices.  The development environment is Eclipse on Linux or Visual Studio on Windows

** Embedded devices **
All diy-efis hardware devices are based on a common hardware family, the dsPIC33EP series from Microchip.  These devices are programmed in C and have the core I/O functions needed by the CANFly systems.  There is a common operating system and I/O drivers for most peripherals.

** Hardware Designs **
All diy-efis hardware designs are open source and are provided in Eagle PCB format.  They are designed to be very low cost 2 sided PCB's that can be hand assembled by a enthusiest.  Kotuku Aerospace will sell boards, partial kits, full kits or assembled hardware based on these designs.

diy-efis is managed by Kotuku Aerospace and any money made from selling kits is used to fund the hosting and designs.
